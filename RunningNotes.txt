docker run -it redis (run redis commands in a terminal)
Image --> Single file with all dependecies and config required to run a program
Container -->  Runtime instance of an image

Docker Ecosystem
Docker client (running commands or docker cli)
Docker server (responsible for creating images, running containers etc)
Docker machine
Docker Images
Docker compose
Docker Hub

*** Docker client does some processing on commands enetered and docker server does the heavy lifting
*** Docker server looks for image cache first if it dosent find then downloads from priavte repo/docker hub.
when running docker on mac/windows it actually installs a Linux VM and then runs processes in the VM.

docker logs container-id (Get logs of a container)
docker stop container-id || docker kill container-id
docker rm container-id
docker ps || docker ps --all

Redis 
docker run redis (Runs the redis server on port 6379 in a container)
To connect to a container then use docker exec -it container-id redis-cli 

Terminal in Container
docker exec -it container-id sh|bash (Run command prompt in a container)
also can use docker run -it image sh
containers always run in isolation

DockerFile
base image  FROM
Run some commands  RUN
commnad to run on container startup  CMD
docker build -t avemula/nginx:latest .

SAMPLE NODE JS APP
docker run -it avemula/sample-node sh
docker exec -it container-id sh
ls will show all the files
exit to get out of container or ctrl+c or ctrl+d
copy package.json and run npm install and then copy all remaining  this will allow cache for the dependecies and then if u change index.js file build would be fast
